=head1 NAME

Mail::DMARC::Result - an aggregate report result object

=head1 VERSION

version 1.20191024

=head1 OVERVIEW

A L<Result|Mail::DMARC::Result> object is the product of instantiating a L<DMARC::PurePerl|Mail::DMARC::PurePerl> object, populating the variables, and running $dmarc->validate. The results object looks like this:

    result       => 'pass',   # pass, fail
    disposition  => 'none',   # reject, quarantine, none
    reason       => [         # there can be many reasons...
            {
                type     => '',   # forwarded, sampled_out, trusted_forwarder,
                comment  => '',   #   mailing_list, local_policy, other
            },
        ],
    dkim         => 'pass',   # pass, fail
    dkim_align   => 'strict', # strict, relaxed
    spf          => 'pass',   # pass, fail
    spf_align    => 'strict', # strict, relaxed
    published    => L<Mail::DMARC::Policy>,

Reasons are optional and may not be present.

The dkim_align and spf_align fields will only be present if the corresponding test value equals pass. They are additional info not specified by the DMARC spec.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 published

Published is a L<Mail::DMARC::Policy> tagged with a domain. The domain attribute is the DNS domain name where the DMARC record was found. This may not be the same as the header_from domain (ex: bounces.amazon.com -vs- amazon.com).

=head2 result

Whether the message passed the DMARC test. Possible values are: pass, fail.

In order to pass, at least one authentication alignment must pass. The 2013 draft defines two authentication methods: DKIM and SPF. The list is expected to grow.

=head2 disposition

When the DMARC result is not I<pass>, disposition is the results of applying DMARC policy to a message. Generally this is the same as the header_from domains published DMARC L<policy|Mail::DMARC::Policy>. When it is not, the reason SHOULD be specified.

=head2 dkim

Whether the message passed or failed DKIM alignment. In order to pass the DMARC DKIM alignment test, a DKIM signature that matches the RFC5322.From domain must be present. An unsigned messsage, a message with an invalid signature, or signatures that don't match the RFC5322.From field are all considered failures.

=head2 dkim_align

If the message passed the DKIM alignment test, this indicates whether the alignment was strict or relaxed.

=head2 spf

Whether the message passed or failed SPF alignment. To pass SPF alignment, the RFC5321.MailFrom domain must match the RFC5322.From field.

=head2 spf_align

If the message passed the SPF alignment test, this indicates whether the alignment was strict or relaxed.

=head2 reason

If the applied policy differs from the sites published policy, the result policy should contain a reason and optionally a comment.

A DMARC result reason has two attributes, type, and comment.

    reason => {
        type =>  '',
        comment => '',
    },

=head3 type

The following reason types are defined and valid:

    forwarded
    sampled_out
    trusted_forwarder
    mailing_list
    local_policy
    other

=head3 comment

Comment is a free form text field.
