=head1 NAME

Mail::DMARC::Report::Send::HTTP - utility methods to send reports by HTTP

=head1 VERSION

version 1.20200113

=head1 12.2.2. HTTP

Where an "http" or "https" method is requested in a Domain Owner's
URI list, the Mail Receiver MAY encode the data using the
"application/gzip" media type ([GZIP]) or MAY send the Appendix C
data uncompressed or unencoded.

The header portion of the POST or PUT request SHOULD contain a
Subject field as described in Section 12.2.1.

HTTP permits the use of Content-Transfer-Encoding to upload gzip
content using the POST or PUT instruction after translating the
content to 7-bit ASCII.
